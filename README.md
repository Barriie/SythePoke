This very simple win32 client opens a pipe to the NOX emulator and simulates GPS movements based on key strokes and a selected location.

Some of the code was programmatically generated (in particular combobox). This code and client are in alpha release and have been rapidly prototyped over a few hours. Bugs are expected.
